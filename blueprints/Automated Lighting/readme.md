# Automated Lighting
This blueprint can help you automate your lights.

## It can do the following:
- Turn on/off lights.
- Turn on different lights during the day and evening/night.
- If a button/remote/switch has been pressed (and gives an action) a cooldown will be triggered. This way if you just switched on/off the lights and moved out the room during the lights won't change.

## This blueprint requires a few things:
- Set up a helper: toggle.
- Set up a binary_sensor in yaml mode (see binary_sensor.yaml and include that in your configuration).
